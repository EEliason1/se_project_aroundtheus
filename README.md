# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Project Description**

This project showed students how to use a combination of grid and flex layout to create a responsive webpage. It also gives an in depth demonstration on different techniques to import fonts in an efficient way. A better understanding on how to opperate GitHub and its terminal was also an integral part of the process.

The reponsive webpage was achieved by creating a grid layout with auto-fit columns. The number of columns would change between 1, 2, and 3 based on the width of the screen media being used. The margins and padding of various elements was also required to change at the different sizes to make the website flow.

**Technology Used**

The intended technology for the website are phones, tablets, and desktops with widths of 320px, 775px, and 1280px, respectively.

I apologize for the video being 12 minutes instead of 5-10. I tried to minimize the content as much as I could but it didn't seem like I could cut enough out and still get the whole point across on how the project was completed.

**Plans to Improve the Project**

One improvement would be to compress some of the code. There are a few line I noticed are repetative and could be removed.

Another improvement would be to add locations for the buttons to actually send the user to. I'm assuming that the next sprint might include that, but if not I'd like to return to this when I have the skillset to do so.

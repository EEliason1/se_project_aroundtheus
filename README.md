# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

I apologize for the video being 12 minutes instead of 5-10. I tried to minimize the content as much as I could but it didn't seem like I could cut enough out and still get the whole point across on how the project was completed.

**Plans to Improve the Project**

One improvement would be to compress some of the code. There are a few line I noticed are repetative and could be removed.

Another improvement would be to add locations for the buttons to actually send the user to. I'm assuming that the next sprint might include that, but if not I'd like to return to this when I have the skillset to do so.
